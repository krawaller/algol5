So, what is the {ME} business model?

Short answer - there isn't one. This is very much an SPP&trade; (Stupid Passion Project), and like all proper SPP:s, light years from being economically viable.

The plan is to set up a Patreon to allow for throwing a voluntary coin in the cap, but this isn't in place yet.

Further down the line there might be hand-curated ads or sponsorshipts, should such an opportunity arise, or paid game inclusions.

But mostly we just expect {ME} to be a black hole in both our wallets and calendars. SPP, after all!

Whatever the future brings, we hereby solemnly swear to the following:

- All gameplay functionality will forever remain free, and not be locked behind paywalls. This includes upcoming functionality like online play and AI opponents.
- If we ever take money from an outside party that will be made abundantly clear (so no, we're not being paid for fawning about {TAG:id=logy,text=LOGY} or {TAG:id=nestorgames,text=Nestor Games}, we're just excited fans like you).
- There will never be automated ads. That's not compatible with the first of the P:s in SPP.
