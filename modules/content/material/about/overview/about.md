Hello!

And, welcome to {ME} - an app that let's you play {COUNT} abstract board games directly in your browser, no server roundtrips needed!

At the moment that is pretty much all it does, though. Game sessions are saved locally but you can't play online, there's no AI, no pretty design, etc.

Hopefully that will slowly change over time, see the Roadmap section for more on what's to come. But likely {ME} will remain what it is - a crude but lovingly crafted tribute to the wonderful world of abstract games!
