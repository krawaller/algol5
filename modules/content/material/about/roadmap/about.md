So, where do we want to take {ME}? After all it is still very much in a beta state.

Here's the list of things we hope to add, in semi-prioritised order!

1. Graphical design
1. Online play
1. AI opponents
1. Dedicated UI for larger screens
1. Bots for Slack, Messenger, Twitter, etc

And, of course - lots and lots more games!
