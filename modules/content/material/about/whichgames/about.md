So, which games gets to pass through {ME}'s gate?

{PIC:name=gate.jpg,cred=Render by MZ,credurl=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1475123332,title=Who gets through?}

Here is the list of conditions a game must fulfil to be eligible for inclusion:

- Two players
- No more than 6 different unit types
- No random chance
- No hidden information
- Small board with square cells
- Not too many different cell types
- No stacking, only one unit per cell
- No stateful board, only units change
- Direction of a unit does not matter
- Simple ruleset

Most of these limitations are political rather than technical - the underlying engine is very versatile, but adhering to these characteristics allows us to keep a coherent UI and makes adding new games easier.

We have a long wishlist of games to add (the previous iteration of {ME} has over 70 games, so just converting those will keep us busy for a while). But if you have a suggestion on a game that should be here, we would be very happy to hear about it!
