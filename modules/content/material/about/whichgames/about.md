So, which games gets to pass through the eye of the needle in {ME}?

{PIC:name=needle.jpg,cred=Stolen from the internet,title=Eye of the needle}

Here is the list of conditions a game must fulfil to be eligible for inclusion:

- Two players
- No more than 6 different unit types
- No random chance
- No hidden information
- Small board with square cells
- Not too many different cell types
- No stacking, only one unit per cell
- No stateful board, only units change
- Direction of a unit does not matter
- Simple ruleset

Most of these limitations are political rather than technical - the underlying engine is very versatile, but adhering to these characteristics allows us to keep a coherent UI and makes it easier to add new games.
