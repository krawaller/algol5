Amazons, or sometimes "Game of the Amazons", was invented by Walter Zamkauskas in 1988. It is a staple among the "modern" abstracts, much loved for the depth given by the simple rules: players take turn to move a unit and burn a square, until someone cannot move and loses.

Because of its popularity there's been much writing and research done around the game, particularly in the AI field.
