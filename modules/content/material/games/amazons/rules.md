{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Each player controls 4 {UNIT:group=amazons}, who move like chess queens.

On their turn a player must first {CMND:name=move} a {UNIT:group=amazons}. They cannot pass or capture any other unit.

After moving they must {CMND:name=fire} a {UNIT:group=fires,owner=0} from the square they moved to. They can fire just like they move - along any straight line, not crossing any other units.

The last player to be able to make a turn wins!

Draws are not possible.
