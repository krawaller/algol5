Aries is played on a [DIM] board with the following setup:

[SETUP]

The player takes turn to [CMND] one of their 16 [UNIT], who moves like chess rooks.

If they move onto an occupied square then that [UNIT], and all [UNIT] in a line behind it, are pushed back. Those who are pushed off the edge are killed.

A pushed [UNIT] may not push back at the [UNIT] who pushed it in the directly subsequent move.

The first player to get a unit into their opponent's starting corner is the winner!
