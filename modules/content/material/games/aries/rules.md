{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

The player takes turn to {CMND} one of their 16 {UNIT}, who moves like chess rooks.

If they move onto an occupied square then that {UNIT}, and all {UNIT} in a line behind it, are pushed back. Those who are pushed off the edge are killed.

A pushed {UNIT} may not push back at the {UNIT} who pushed it in the directly subsequent move.

The first player to get a unit into their opponent's starting corner is the winner!
