{GAME} was programmed by Dave Crummack and Craig Galley in 1988 with the name Infection, but eventually it became the arcade game {GAME} under the Virgin Mastertronic banner.

It has since appeared in many guises, perhaps most famously as a puzzle in the popular adventure game {EXTLINK:url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7th_Guest,text=The 7th Guest}. As part of a {EXTLINK:url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roblanderos/the-7th-guest-board-game/posts/2528543,text=Kickstarter campaign for a board game version} for that game, a physical edition of {GAME} was made available as {EXTLINK:url=https://the-7th-guest-board-game.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders/84524,text=The 7th Guest: Infection}.

That's a very convoluted backstory for a simple abstract. But, there's a reason for its longevity, and that is that {GAME} is a really solid game! Not to mention thematic; the clever jump-or-split has a distinctly viral feel to it...
