{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Players take turn to act with their {UNIT}, doing one of two things:

- {CMND:name=jump} to an empty square two steps away (allowing diagonals)
- {CMND:name=split} by spawning a new {UNIT} in an empty adjacent square

In both cases, after acting, all enemy {UNIT} adjacent to the target square are taken over by the acting player.

When the board is full, the player with the most {UNIT} wins!
