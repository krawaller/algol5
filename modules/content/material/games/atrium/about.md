In Atrium, invented by {EXTLINK:text=Guy Jeandel,url=http://jeuxjeandel.com/} in 2004, players race to be the first to arrange one of their two unit types into a line. There's very little information about the game online apart from the {EXTLINK:text=World of Abstract Games entry,url=http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/atrium.htm} on which the {ME} implementation is based.

Curiously, there is a {EXTLINK:text=stub Board Game Geek entry,url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63766/atrium} with a single image that doesn't match the WoAG ruleset:

{PIC:name=atrium.jpg,cred=Pic from BGG user Ivyco,title=Atrium with different rules?}

Here there seems to be alternate starting conditions, and a fourth unit of one of the unit types. Also note the clever solution with playing on the intersections of cut-off marbles!
