In {GAME}, invented by {EXTLINK:text=Guy Jeandel,url=http://jeuxjeandel.com/} in 2004, players race to be the first to arrange one of their two unit types into a line, pushing each other out of the way.

Interestingly there is also a ruleset for solitaire play, where the player attempt to form formation given on cards. These can be seen in the below image.

Also note the clever solution with playing on the intersections of cut-off marbles!

Special thanks to Ivy Colin who helped track down the complete ruleset.
