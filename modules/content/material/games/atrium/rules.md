Atrium is played on a [DIM] board with the following starting setup:

[SETUP]

Each turn players move one of their [UNIT:group=kings,owner=12] or [UNIT:group=queens,owner=12] one orthogonal step to an unoccupied square.

If that makes an orthogonal or diagonal 3-in-a-row of all three units of that type, the player wins!
