{GAME} was invented by {TAG:id=huntoon} in the early 2000's, inspired by the cult Missile Command arcade game.

In {GAME} your pieces play triple duty; they attack your enemy, they infiltrate her base and guard your own. This gives remarkable tactical depth in spite of the simple rules!

The initial setup and movement is identical to {GAME:id=breakthrough} but don't be fooled - the additional detonation mechanism makes for a very different game.
