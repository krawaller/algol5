{GAME} is the award-winning crown achievement by {TAG:id=troyka,text=Dan Troyka}. The trivial rules generate a dazzling emergent complexity, studied and envied by many!

It is rather similar to {GAME:id=uglyduck}, also by Troyka, but lacks the promotion and race back home.

Thanks to its fame there is a fair amount of interesting writing to find about {GAME}. For example it was (briefly) covered in {TAG:id=hundredother,text=Addison's book 100 other games to play on a chessboard}.
