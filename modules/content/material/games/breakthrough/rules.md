{GAME} is played on a {DIM:board=basic} (regular variant) or {DIM:board=mini} (mini variant) board with the following setups:

<div class="md-2col">
{SETUP:board=basic,name=basic}
{SETUP:board=mini,name=mini}
</div>

Players take turn to {CMND} their {UNIT} one step closer towards the opponent base, straight forward or diagonally. Diagonal moves can capture by replacement.

First to have a {UNIT} reach the opponent base wins!
