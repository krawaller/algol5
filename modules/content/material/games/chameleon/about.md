{GAME} was invented by Mitsuo Yamamoto in 2019. As with all his games he makes and sells beautiful ceramic versions through {EXTLINK:text=LOGY games,url=http://www.logygames.com/}.

{GAME} was funded by a {EXTLINK:text=Kickstarter campaign,url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/logygames/chameleon-a-modern-version-of-chess}, which typically is the best opportunity to place international orders for LOGY games (although they do ship worldwide from their site too).

In {GAME} the pieces have different moving depending on where they are on the board, which is a recurring theme in Yamamoto's games. So is the knife-fight-in-an-elevator feeling brought by the small board and victory conditions egging the players forward. {GAME} battles are unavoidably short, tactical and bloody!
