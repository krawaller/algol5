Coffee is a delightful abstract by Néstor Romeral Andrés, and thus of course published by Nestor games.

At first glance Coffee is a trivial placing game, but there is of course a twist; after placing a unit (coffee bean?), you get to limit where your opponent can place next turn. Only by mastering both choices will you excel at this game!

Since the board inevitably fills up, Coffee always maintain a cutthroat pace and never outstays its welcome.

When you buy Coffee from Nestor Games you get both a hex and a square board (and enough pieces to play both in parallell), where [ME] implements only the latter.

The Nestor version have you dictate opponent options through putting a rod on your newly deployed unit (which gives a coffee bean look, hence the game name), while in [ME] the opponent options are represented by neutral units instead.
