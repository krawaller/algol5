{GAME} was invented by Howard Wexler and Ned Strongin, and first published by Milton Bradley in 1974.

Considered trivial by many for being solved and having ridiculously simple rule, {GAME} still deserves some reverence for being one of the most successful abstracts ever. And a great kids game to boot!

It is also being sold as Captain's Mistress, with a popular wooden edition put forth by WE Games.

While we do understand why {GAME} has an abysmal rating over on Board Game Geek, nothing can take away the amount of fun we had as children with this game!
