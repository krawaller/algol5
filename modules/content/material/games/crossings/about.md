{GAME} was invented by Robert Abott in 1969, and described in Sackson's legendary book {TAG:id=gamut,text=A Gamut of Games}.

At {ME} we stay with the firstborn {GAME}, which is a better fit for us with its smaller board and faster gameplay. It is easy to see why {GAME} has survived - the phalanx-based movement makes the game supremely tactical, without much rules overhead at all.

While Epaminondas is also an excellent game, I can't help but prefer the delicious and ferocious quick battles that {GAME} has to offer!
