Daggers was invented in 2002 by Luke Weisman.

The hook is an intriguing assymetry between the players - {PLR:who=1} has a superior position at the top of the hill, but {PLR:who=2} fields a far larger army. Which advantage will be worth the most?

The clever uphill mechanism also ensures that tension mounts as the game progresses, since the {PLR:who=2} army trudges inevitably closer.
