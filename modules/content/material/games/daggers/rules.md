Daggers is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Players take turn to move one of their units.

- A {UNIT:group=crowns} moves and captures like a chess king.
- A {UNIT:group=daggers} moves in any direction except east-west. When heading "uphill" (northwards) they can only move 1 step, "downhill" (southwards) they move any number of steps. They capture enemies, except for other {UNIT:group=daggers} orthogonally.

There are two ways to win:

- {ENDGAME:name=infiltration}: move a {UNIT:group=crowns} into the opponent base
- {ENDGAME:name=regicide}: kill an opponent {UNIT:group=crowns}

Draws are not possible.
