{GAME} is played on a {DIM:board=basic} with this setup:

<div class="md-2col">
{SETUP:name=basic,board=basic}
{SETUP:name=basic,board=noborder}
</div>

Regular "desdemona" shown to the left, "cassio" and "iago" variants to the right (see further below).

There are two types of units in {GAME}:

- A {UNIT:group=amazons} can move and shoot out a {UNIT:group=stones} of the same colour.
- A {UNIT:group=stones} will never move, but can be **flipped** to become the opponent colour. There are also neutral {UNIT:group=stones,who=0}, these cannot be **flipped**.

On their turn a player will do two things in order:

1. First they {CMND:name=move} one of their {UNIT:group=amazons} orthodiagonally across any number of empty squares (like a chess queen)
1. Now the moved {UNIT:group=amazons} will {CMND:name=fire} in one of these ways:
   - shoot a neutral {UNIT:group=stones,who=0} orthodiagonally across any number of empty squares (just like in {GAME:id=amazons}), but not onto a border space
   - Shoot an own-coloured {UNIT:group=stones} across any number of enemy {UNIT:group=stones}, landing on an empty square behind them. This **flips** all the jumped {UNIT:group=stones} (sort of like in Othello).

On the very first turn of the game {PLR:who=1} will only {CMND:name=move} and not {CMND:name=fire}.

The game ends when a player is unable to move, and the winner is whoever has the most {UNIT:group=stones}!

<div class="md-example">

Here {UNIT:group=amazons,who=1,at=a1} shoots out {UNIT:group=stones,who=1,at=d4} (left)...

<div class="md-2col">
{ARR:name=beforefiring,from=a1,to=d1}
{ARR:name=afterfiring,from=a1,to=d1}
</div>

...which captures {UNIT:group=stones,who=2,at=a2} and {UNIT:group=stones,who=2,at=a3} (right).

</div>

Besides the regular rule there are two variants for the game:

- The "cassio" variant changes two rules for when you {CMND:name=fire}:
  - You always {CMND:name=fire} a neutral {UNIT:group=stones,who=0}, even when firing to **flip**
  - There is no board perimeter rule
- The "iago" variant introduces the following changes:
  - You may move past pieces of your own colour
  - You always {CMND:name=fire} a {UNIT:group=stones} of your own colour
  - You can only {CMND:name=fire} across empty spaces, not across opponent stones
  - Opponent stones will **flip** if caught on an orthodiagonal line between the fired stone and another unit of your colour - like when placing in Othello!
  - There is no board perimeter rule
