{GAME} was invented by {TAG:id=walterjoris,text=Walter Joris} around Y2K, and published in his amazing book {TAG:id=walterjoris,text=100 Strategic Game for Pen and Paper}.

Like most games in the book {GAME} is characterised by pieces being continuously added, never moved or removed. This in combination with the line extension mechanic makes for a fast but rather deep game, difficult to play well!
