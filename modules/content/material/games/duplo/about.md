{GAME} was invented by {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=Walter Joris} around Y2K, and published in his amazing book {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=100 Strategic Game for Pen and Paper}.

Like most games in the book {GAME} is characterised by pieces being continuously added, never moved or removed. This in combination with the line extension mechanic makes for a fast but rather deep game, difficult to play well!
