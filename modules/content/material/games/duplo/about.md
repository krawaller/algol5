{GAME} was invented by Walter Joris around Y2K, and published in his amazing book {EXTLINK:text=100 strategic games for pen and paper,url=https://www.amazon.com/100-Strategic-Games-Walter-Joris/dp/1842227270}

{GAME} is characterised by pieces being added, never moved or removed (after all, the title of the book isn't "...for pen and paper and eraser"). This in combination with the line extension mechanic makes for a fast but rather deep game, difficult to play well!
