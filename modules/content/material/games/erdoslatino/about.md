{GAME} was invented by Jorge Nuños Silva in 2011. It has been published by LuduScience.

The name comes from Latin Squares and Paul Erdös. For more on the latter, read the brilliant book "The Boy who Loved Math"! For more on the former, play a Sudoku...

Silva's game is quite the achievement! He leverages the mathematics of latin squares, and combines it with ingenious rules for column dominance to produce a really clever game that plays like no other.
