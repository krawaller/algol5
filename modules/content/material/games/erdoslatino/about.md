{GAME} was invented by Jorge Nuno Silva in 2011. It has been published by LuduScience.

The name comes from Latin Squares and Paul Erd√∂s. For more on the latter, read the brilliant book "The Boy who Loved Math"! For more on the former, play a Sudoku...

Silva's game is quite the achievement! He leverages the mathematics of latin squares, and combines it with ingenious rules for column dominance to produce a really clever game with distinct play.
