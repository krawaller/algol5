{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Players take turn to {CMND} one of their units:

- {UNIT:group=kings} move like a chess queen
- {UNIT:group=soldiers} move like a chess rook. After moving, imagine orthogonal lines extending from your {UNIT:group=kings} and the moved {UNIT:group=soldiers}, and kill any enemy {UNIT:group=soldiers} in the two intersections.

Win by reducing your opponent to 2 or fewer pieces!
