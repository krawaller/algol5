Gekitai, which is japanese for "repel", is a game by Scott Brady introduced in 2020. We were immediately smitten by how the simple rules offered deep strategies, and how the dual win conditions made the choices even more delicious.

So in spite of being a very new game, we anticipate Gekitai remaining a favourite of ours for quite some time!

The game was added to {ME} in February 2020 during a lunch lecture for programmers at a top Fortune 500 company, showing off the versatility of the engine and how easy it is to add a new game.

If Gekitai tickles your fancy you should also check out {GAME:gameId=gekitai}, which shares a similar drop-push flow.
