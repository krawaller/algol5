{GAME} was brought to the world by Gustav Levay in 2002. Legend has it that it was invented in prison, where no pen and paper was allowed!

The name {GAME} - which is math speak for a {EXTLINK:text=very large number,url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol} - refers to the explosive branching the game gets from allowing pawns to move anywhere on the board.

There is some interesting commentary on {GAME} in Neto's and Silva's book {TAG:id=netobook,text=Mathematical GamesCOMMA Abstract Games}.
