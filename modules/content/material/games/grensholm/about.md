{GAME} refers to the home of the famous warlord and Kings councilman Magnus Stensson Gren that turned into a pirate. Grensholm is located on the Northern shore of lake Roxen, 15 miles East of Norrköping. On the site, there is a now ruined castle, Borgen Ål, the home of Sten Haraldsson Gren, the father of Magnus, and a more modern Manor House, the actual Grensholm.
