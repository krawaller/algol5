{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Players take turn to move their {UNIT:group=soldiers} one step closer to the opponent base. They move like knights in chess, except you must move towards the opponent's side.

A {UNIT:group=soldiers} reaching the opponent base is promoted to a {UNIT:group=kings}, which has the exact same movement pattern but in reverse.

The first player to safely return a {UNIT:group=kings} to her home base wins!
