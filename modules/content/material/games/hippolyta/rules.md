{GAME} is played on a {DIM:board=basic} or {DIM:board=mini} board with spiral setups:

<div class="md-2col">
{SETUP:name=basic,board=basic}
{SETUP:name=mini,board=mini}
</div>

Regular variant to the left, mini variant to the right.

Players take turn to make one of their {UNIT:group=amazons} {CMND:name=fire} at an opponent, orthodiagonally across any number of empty spaces. The firing amazon does not move, and the target is killed.

If a player is unable to find a target, the opponent wins by {ENDGAME:name=starvation}.
