{GAME} was invented by {TAG:id=troyka,text=Dan Troyka} in 1998, loosely inspired by {GAME:id=neutron}

It is lovingly covered in {TAG:id=netobook,text=Neto's & Silva's book}.

The neat tactics in {GAME} as you push and pull at the neutral units to get to the enemy makes it one of our absolute favourites in Troyka's vast catalogue.
