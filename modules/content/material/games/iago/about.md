{GAME} was invented by {TAG:id=reyalicea} in 2020.

It has an interesting lineage; it combines ideas from {GAME:id=partisans}, which is an {GAME:id=amazons} refinement, with the {GAME:id=amazons}-Othello mashup {GAME:id=desdemona}.

In spite of this {GAME} is neither convoluted or derivative, but a remarkably streamlined game with a flair and flavour of its own.
