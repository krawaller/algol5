{GAME} is another splendid Yamamoto entry in the {TAG:id=logy,text=LOGY games} catalogue.

Like the rest of its ilk it sports a cramped board and tight ruleset, delivering a very tactical and bloody battle.

We really, really like this one! Changing movement and off-board deployment offers a multitude of choices in spite of the board size, and the dual victory conditions keep you on your toes!

On the Kickstarter campaign page there's some interesting information about the game's development; it started out on a much bigger board, then gradually shrank down into the final version!

The name "Kachit" comes from the sound a channel-changing knob makes on an old TV, alluding to how players switch directions of units during play.

In {ME} units don't have direction, so we support the "kachit" part through switching between unit types instead.
