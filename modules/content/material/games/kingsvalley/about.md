{GAME} was invented by Mitsuo Yamamoto of {INTLINK:text=LOGY Games,url=/tags/logy_games} in 2006. Like for his other games he offers beautiful ceramic implementations of {GAME} at his webshop!

Even though {GAME} has no capturing, it still retains the snappy feeling of Yamamoto's other games (like {GAME:id=chameleon}).
