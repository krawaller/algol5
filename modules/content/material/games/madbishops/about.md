As mr Steere himself {EXTLINK:url=https://rec.games.abstract.narkive.com/24O4DeQa/new-msg-game-mad-bishops,text=said about the game}:

> I can't rule out Mad Bishops as my best game at this point. It's an ultra simple game with TAD (total assured destruction). What's not to like?

We can only agree! Don't let the simple rules fool you - {GAME} is a really clever game, lovingly tailored to ensure an interesting battle with tough decisions.
