{GAME} is another great game from Philip Leduc, the mastermind behind the splendid {GAME:id=murusgallicus} and {GAME:id=gowiththefloe}.

Games of {GAME} are typically very fast, as players take turn to drop their units onto the board, pushing each other around as they try to get all pieces out.

If you enjoy {GAME} make sure to also try {GAME:id=gekitai}, which plays very similarly!

{GAME} was added to {ME} during a lunch lecture at {EXTLINK:url=https://www.edument.se/,text=Edument}, showing off the engine to their programmers.
