Games of Momentum are typically very fast, as players take turn to drop their units onto the board, pushing each other around as they try to get all pieces out.

If you enjoy Momentum make sure to also try [GAME:gameId=gekitai], which plays very similarly!

Momentum was added to [ME] during a lunch lecture at [EXTLINK:url=https://www.edument.se/,text=Edument], showing off the engine to their programmers.
