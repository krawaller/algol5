It very much follows the formula of his other games; rewards long-term thinking, extremely positional, and no draws possible. In other words a very solid game!

The board ({DIM}) is really too big for the {ABOUT:id=whichgames,text=kind of games} we'd normally include, but {GAME} was just too cool to pass on...
