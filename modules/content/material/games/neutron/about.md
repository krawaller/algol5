{GAME} was invented by Robert A. Krauss in the early 70:s, and published in an issue of the Games & Puzzles magazine.

It is a simple (and solved) game, but even so, the easy rules and tug-of-war over the common neutral unit makes for interesting play!

{ME} also implements the Paper Neutron variant that {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=Walter Joris} describes in {INTLINK:url=/tags/walter_joris_and_100_strategic_games_for_pen_and_paper,text=100 Strategic Games for Pen & Paper}.

In this variant - presumably as a concession to having the players constantly redraw the board state - Joris made the board smaller and added a second neutron, which makes for a very quick and vicious game!
