{GAME} was published by Parker Brothers in the 70s.

{GAME} is a simple race to be the first to scatter your pieces across the board. What makes it interesting is that one of the 9 board quadrants are missing, and instead of moving you can slide another quadrant into the hole.

{ME} can't replicate this exactly like that since our boards are never stateful, so we have replaced the hole with a troop of neutral units working in exactly the same way.
