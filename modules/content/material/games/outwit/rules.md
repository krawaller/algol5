{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Each turn a player can:

- {CMND:name=move} a {UNIT:group=soldiers} orthogonally, as far as it can in that direction.
- {CMND:name=move} a {UNIT:group=kings} who move like chess queens.

Pieces must slide as far as they can go. They stop only when they reach the end of the board, the oponents corner or another piece.

If you, after moving, have all your pieces in your corner, you win!
