{GAME} was invented by Luis Bola√±os Mures in 2020.

It takes {GAME:id=amazons} and adds a seemingly innocent rule; you can now move and fire past units of your own colour. With this simple addition Luis managed to turn {GAME:id=amazons} into a very different beast!

The game now has a much bigger potential for surprising escapes and daring attacks. Partisan warfare indeed!
