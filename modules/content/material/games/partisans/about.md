{GAME} was invented by Luis Bolaños Mures in 2020, as an adaption of {TAG:id=reyalicea}'s {GAME:id=desdemona}.

With a couple of very simple rules tweaks...

- allowing movement and firing over like-coloured units
- removing the scoring, last to move wins instead

...Luis managed to turn {GAME:id=desdemona} into a very different beast. His rules brings back the focus on territory à la {GAME:id=amazons}, but with a much bigger potential for surprising escapes and daring attacks. Partisan warfare indeed!
