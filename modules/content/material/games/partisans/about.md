{GAME} was invented by Luis Bola√±os Mures in 2020, starting out as an adaption of {TAG:id=reyalicea}'s {GAME:id=desdemona}.

After some rule iterations {GAME} now plays exactly like {GAME:id=amazons}, except you can move and fire past units of your own colour.

With this simple addition Luis managed to turn {GAME:id=desdemona} into a very different beast! His rules keeps the territorial nature of {GAME:id=amazons} but with a much bigger potential for surprising escapes and daring attacks. Partisan warfare indeed!
