Razzle Dazzle was invented by Donald Green in 2005, then under the name Knight Moves.

In hard competition with {GAME:id=speedsoccolot} this is probably our favourite sports-like game. The inherent friction between knight moves and straight passes, along with the ingenious "tournament rule" that lets you force an opponent to pass by moving next to her ball carrier, makes for a surprisingly deep game with a very basketbally feel!
