{GAME} was published by wooden toy company Montgomery Schoolhouse in the 70s. Their lineup was mostly pure toys like cars and trains, but included the odd game such as this one:

Montgomery schoolhouse are still around today, as part of {EXTLINK:url=https://www.maplelandmark.com/,text=Maple Landmark}. Their webshop is well worth a visit if you enjoy wood- and love-based products!

There is very little known about {GAME} beyond the rules. We've reached out for more information, and will update this article if we get it!

{GAME} is a simple race to be the first to scatter your pieces across the board. What makes it interesting is that one of the 9 board quadrants are missing, and instead of moving you can slide another quadrant into the hole.

{ME} can't replicate this exactly like that since our boards are never stateful, so we have replaced the hole with a troop of neutral units working in exactly the same way.
