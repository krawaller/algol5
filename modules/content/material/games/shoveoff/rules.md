{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board, initially filled with neutral {UNIT:group=soldiers,who=0}:

{SETUP}

The players take turn to shove one of their off-board {UNIT:group=soldiers} onto an edge square, displacing the row or column so that the unit on the opposite edge is shoved off.

It is not allowed to:

- shove off an opponent {UNIT:group=soldiers}
- shove in the opposite direction of the directly previous shove

If a player already has all 8 {UNIT:group=soldiers} on the board, she shoves in a neutral {UNIT:group=soldiers,who=0} instead.

If after the show the player has 4 units in a line, including diagonals, she wins!
