Speed Soccolot was designed by Robert Kraus in 2003, as a variant of David Wilson's Soccolot from 1972 (which is also playable here).

There are many football-inspired abstract games, but few manage it better than Soccolot! The simple rules still allow for distinguishing between running, dribbling and kicking, allowing for both tactical depth and strong football associations.
