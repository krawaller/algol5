{GAME} was invented by Néstor Romeral Andrés in 2011 as a simplification of {EXTLINK:url=https://nestorgames.com/#yavalath_detail,text=Yavalath}, the famous first invented-by-a-computer-program game.

{GAME} takes Yavalath's board, shrinks it and uses square cells instead of hexes. The result is of course a simpler game, but that also means it is more accessible. And, somehow it gets a certain flair of its own!
