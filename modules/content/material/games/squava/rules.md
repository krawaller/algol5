{GAME} is played on an initially empty {DIM} board.

Players take turn to {CMND:name=drop} a {UNIT:group=markers} on any free square.

On her first turn {PLR:who=2} may instead invoke the {CMND:name=pie} rule and steal {PLR:who=1}'s unit.

After a {CMND:name=drop}, if...

- you made **3 in a row**, you **lose**
- you made **4 in a row**, you **win**
- the board is **full**, the game is a **draw**

Lines include diagonals.
