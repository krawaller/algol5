{GAME} was invented in 2002 by Jorge Nu√±o Silva. It is covered in {TAG:id=netobook,text=his and Neto's book} as "Stooges", and has been published by LuduScience as "Estarolas".

In spite of being a seemingly simple get-3-in-a-row game, {GAME} has very novel play stemming from the option of moving or switching a square colour.
