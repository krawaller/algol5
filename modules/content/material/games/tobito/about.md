{GAME} has all the hallmarks of a Yamamoto game: small board, simple rules, very quick play, yet still with deep and interesting decisions.

At first glance {GAME} seems like a trivial racing game, but the ingenious relocation rule in combination with the full-home-base lose condition makes for a surpisingly tactical challenge!

And, of course, the ceramic edition sold by LOGY games is splendidly beautiful. There is a {EXTLINK:text=Kickstarter campaign,url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/logygames/tobito} running from June 18th through 30th, so if you read this during this time, be sure to check it out!
