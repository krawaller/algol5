{GAME} was created by Alan Parr in 1985, and has been published by UK company Fiendish Games.

Parr's goal was to create a game that...

- took seconds to explain
- took minutes to play
- required no fancy pieces
- wasn't trivial

We definitely feel he succeeded!

In the original game red pieces turn yellow and then green, hence the name {GAME}. In {ME} we instead use different unit types.
