{GAME} was invented by {TAG:id=troyka,text=Dan Troyka} in 2002. The main selling point is the digdugesque tunneling mechanic where players dig through bedrock to get to one another.

A rarity among abstracts, {GAME} sports a rather hilarious backstory!

> You were supposed to dig a tunnel connecting England and France but somebody lost the map. Now your crew is somewhere under the North Atlantic between Ireland and Iceland. The English workers (Red) blame the French and the French workers (Blue) blame the English. You have decided to settle the matter with a death match.
