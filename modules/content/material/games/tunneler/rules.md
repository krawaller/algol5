{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Players take turn to {CMND} one of their {UNIT:group=tunnelers} or {UNIT:group=foremen} like chess rooks across any number of empty spaces.

Both units can "dig" by capturing a {UNIT:group=rocks,who=0}, except there may never be a 2x2 square without a {UNIT:group=rocks,who=0} since that would make the tunnel collapse.

A {UNIT:group=tunnelers} can also capture enemy units, but a {UNIT:group=foremen} cannot.

Win by capturing one of the enemy {UNIT:group=foremen}!
