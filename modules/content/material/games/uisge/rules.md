{GAME} is played on a {DIM} board with the following setup:

{SETUP}

Players take turn to do one of these things:

- {CMND:name=jump} a {UNIT:group=soldiers} or {UNIT:group=kings} over an orthogonally adjacent unit into an empty space. After jumping a {UNIT:group=soldiers} becomes a {UNIT:group=kings} and vice versa.
- {CMND:name=step} with a {UNIT:group=kings} into an orthogonally or diagonally adjacent empty space.

All units must stay orthogonally connected as one single group at all times.

Win by having all your units turned into {UNIT:group=kings}!
