{GAME} is played on a {DIM:board=basic} or {DIM:board=mini} board with one of these two setups:

<div class="md-2col">
{SETUP:name=basic,board=basic}
{SETUP:name=mini,board=mini}
</div>

Regular variant to the left, mini variant to the right.

Players take turn to {CMND} one of their {UNIT} to a neighbouring square. Diagonal movements are allowed if the {UNIT} has left the home castle. Capture by replacement.

Win by moving into the opponent throne!
