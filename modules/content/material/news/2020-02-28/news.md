We recently had two opportunities to show off the data format for games that power {ME}. Last week, at a lunch lecture for programmers at Apple's site in Malm√∂, Sweden, David demoed the app by adding {GAME:id=gekitai} while the audience watched.

Then yesterday we had a similar session at {EXTLINK:text=Edument,url=https://www.edument.se}, whose programmers got to watched as {GAME:id=momentum} was added in a similar fashion.
