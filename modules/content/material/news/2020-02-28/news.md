We recently had two opportunities to show off the data format for games in {ME}. Last week, at a lunch lecture for programmers at Apple in Malm√∂, David demoed the app by adding {GAME:id=gekitai} before the audience had finished eating.

Then yesterday we had a similar session at {EXTLINK:text=Edument,url=https://www.edument.se}, whose programmers got to watched as {GAME:id=momentum} was added in a similar fashion.

The ease with which new games can be added is one of the main strengths of {ME}'s architecture, and being able to brag about it to these two crowds of ridiculously talented programmers was a very energizing experience!
