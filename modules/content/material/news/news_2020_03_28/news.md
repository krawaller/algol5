Even though {ME} has lived for over a decade - albeight in different shapes and through many rebirths - it has never had proper support for game variants. A rather embarrassing omission!

This meant that whenever we actually did want variants, such as having the advanced version of {GAME:id=murusgallicus}, the variant was added as a separate game.

But today we're happy to announce that {ME} got proper variant support! So now if you want to fire catapults in {GAME:id=murusgallicus} you can just select that variant instead of navigating to a separate game entry.

We also took the opportunity to add {GAME:id=kingsvalley} with three variants; regular, a more advanced setup, and a bigger more complex board.

And finally we added {GAME:id=neutron}, including the neat Paper Neutron variant.
