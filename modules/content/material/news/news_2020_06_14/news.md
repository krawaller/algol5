Today {ME} is publicly available! Still beta, still not widely advertised, still missing online play, still ugly as sin.

But, we're having a birthday party nonetheless! Hopefully the toddler will learn more tricks as it gets older...

Anyhow, extra welcome to you for joining in during these humble beginnings! Should you find something amiss or have ideas on improvements, please don't hesitate to reach out to us through the link on the title page!
