From somewhat humble beginnings, a deluge of new games added over the summer has now brought the {ME} library to over 50 games!

Some of the new additions include the {TAG:id=troyka} masterpiece {GAME:id=tunneler}, {TAG:id=huntoon}'s lovely {GAME:id=bombardment} and {GAME:id=euclid}, and {TAG:id=reyalicea}'s brilliant {GAME:id=desdemona}.

Going forward we will of course keep adding new games - join the slack if you want to take part, link on the front page! - but focus will be on finally finishing online play. More on that to follow, hopefully soon!
