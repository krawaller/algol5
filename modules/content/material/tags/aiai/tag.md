{EXTLINK:url=http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/,text=AiAi} is a magical program created by Steven Taverner. It is an abstract game platform implemented in Java, with a large library of games and possiblity of online play.

However, as the name implies, the central focus is on the AI. The AiAi program comes with a variety of AI:s to pit your skills against, and also has a bunch of tools for analysis.
