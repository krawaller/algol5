In 1983 Peter Owen Publishers published "100 other games to play on a chessboard" by Stephen Addison.

It has many similarities to {TAG:id=walterjoris,text=100 strategic games for pen and paper} by Walter Joris. Not just in name but also in character - both are loving curations of simple but crunchy games, presented with warmth and a geekiness level that makes you sense a kindred spirit in the author.
