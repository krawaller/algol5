NestorGames is board game publisher of Diagon Alley level magic. It is run by prolific game designer {EXTLINK:url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/9393/nestor-romeral-andres,text=Néstor Romeral Andrés}. They sell beautiful high-quality abstract games in portable format, typically with acrylic pieces, neoprene boards and cloth containers. {EXTLINK:url=https://nestorgames.com/#shopext,text=Their webshop} is one of my absolute favourite places on the internet!

Next to their awesome catalogue of pure abstracts, NestorGames also publishes the supremely beautiful skirmish game Arcade. Near the top of my bucket list is to buy a collection and play a game under a blacklight!
