In 2013 {EXTLINK:url=https://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/,text=Joao Pedro Neto} (who gave us the best site on the entire internet, namely {EXTLINK:url=http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/,text=World of Abstract Games}) teamed up with fellow academic and game designer {EXTLINK:url=http://jnsilva.ludicum.org/,text=Jorge Nuno Silva} and published the brilliant book "Mathematical Games, Abstract Games" via {EXTLINK:url=https://store.doverpublications.com/0486499901.html,text=Dover Publications}.

The book is an absolute treasure trove of game descriptions, each not only with precise rule explanations but also insightful commentary about the game's nature and context.

Highly, highly recommended read to all abstract geeks!
