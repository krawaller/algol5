Rey Alicea is a board game designing navy veteran artist from the US.

{PIC:name=reyformula.jpg,title=The formula for Rey!,cred=Pics by LEGO,credurl=http://lego.com}

{GAME:id=descent} has long been a favourite game of ours, and we feel blessed to have gotten to see the process for creating {GAME:id=desdemona} and {GAME:id=sapos} up close.

Rey has been an excellent friend of {ME}, and we can't wait to see what he gets up to next!
