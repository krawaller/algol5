Walter Joris is a multi-talented Belgian artist and actor. Among his creative output is some seriously delicious abstract art:

And, of course, he authored this {EXTLINK:url=https://www.amazon.com/Walter-Joris/e/B00PEWESQ6,text=very magical book}, which is somewhat more relevant to our cause:

The games he describe are mostly characterised by simplicity and a quick pace, since you will keep adding stuff with your Pen to the Paper boards. The book isn't called "...for Pen, Paper and Eraser"!
