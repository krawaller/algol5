// Here you can define 'animations' to be applied when a command is executed.
// There are 3 types:
// - enterFrom: An object where keys and values are positions. A unit at a key position
//   will be animated as if coming from the corresponding value position
// - exitTo: Also an object of positions. A unit killed at a key position will be animated
//   as if fading out to the corresponding value position
// - ghost: A "temporary" unit entering from a square and exiting to another, then disappearing.
//   Useful for showing "shots", or the source of a change. You need to specify unit type and
//   owner for each ghost, as well as source and destination.
